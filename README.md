This plugin template uses Typescript and NPM, two standard tools in creating JavaScript applications.

Using TypeScript requires a compiler to convert TypeScript (code.ts) into JavaScript (code.js)
for the browser to run.

We recommend writing TypeScript code using Visual Studio code:

Compile TypeScript to JavaScript: Run the "Terminal > Run Build Task..." menu item,
then select "tsc: watch - tsconfig.json". You will have to do this again every time
you reopen Visual Studio Code.

That's it! Visual Studio Code will regenerate the JavaScript file every time you save.
